    <h1>Why I'm here?</h1>
      <p>I'm in this Web development course because I would want to see if it would be a fulfilling career path and ultimately needed a class to graduate.  
        I have created a few personal websites before, <br>but have forgotten quite a bit as it was a long time ago. I hope to learn
        javascript frameworks. I have never got to incorporate frameworks nor vanilla javascrip into my previous personal websites. 
    </p>
